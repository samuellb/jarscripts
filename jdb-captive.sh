# How to use:
#   1. Start this script. It starts a shell
#   2. Start any processes that spawn Java processes from the new shell
#   3. Find out the port of the java processes with either of the following:
#       (a) the "captive-log", from INSIDE the captive shell
#       (b) with "less /tmp/tmp.*-captive/.log"
#       (c) with "netstat -tuan"
#   4. jdb -attach PORT
